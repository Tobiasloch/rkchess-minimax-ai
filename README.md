# rkchess-minimax-ai

This is a racing kings chess ai. I was building it in a university project a few years ago. It was originally written in c. Now i added a cpp gui around it to make it usable again.

## Usage

Run `make` to compile the code. The binary is then in `./bin/rkchess`. To get information on how to use it run `./bin/rkchess --help`.
